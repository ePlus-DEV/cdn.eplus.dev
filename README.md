# CDN (Content Delivery Network)

CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a system designed to deliver online content to users quickly and efficiently. It operates by distributing content from a resource origin to multiple distributed servers located worldwide, placed close to end users.

When a user accesses a website or downloads an online document, the request is sent to the origin server where the file or content is stored. However, with CDN, the content is replicated and stored on multiple distributed servers globally. When there is a request, CDN selects the server closest to the user to serve the content.

This distributed model helps reduce latency and page load time, providing a better user experience. By placing servers close to end users, CDN reduces network hops and increases data transfer speed. Additionally, CDN offloads traffic from the origin server, enhancing scalability and system stability.

CDN is not only used for static content such as images, videos, CSS files, or JavaScript, but also enables processing and distribution of dynamic content such as data generated from web applications or online games. This optimizes the serving of diverse content on the Internet platform.

In summary, CDN is an essential system that improves the speed and performance of delivering online content. By distributing content from servers close to users, CDN enhances the user experience and reduces load on the origin server, while increasing system readiness and stability.
